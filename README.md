## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates the power of deep learning in computer vision tasks, achieving high accuracy in classifying images into 10 different categories.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a carefully designed CNN model optimized for CIFAR-10.
- **Data Normalization**: Enhances model performance through proper data preprocessing.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Implements dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides insightful plots of model performance and prediction results.
- **Efficient Training**: Implements early stopping and model checkpointing for optimal training.

## 📊 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Classes: 🛩️ Airplane, 🚗 Automobile, 🐦 Bird, 🐈 Cat, 🦌 Deer, 🐕 Dog, 🐸 Frog, 🐎 Horse, 🚢 Ship, 🚚 Truck
